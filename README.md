A music lovers paradise, where the user can search and find their favoured artist and easily navigate to their desired album or find an album they never knew existed, all the while being able to see the track listing and hear samples.

The site is directed at music lovers and hobbyists rather than businesses.

#### The users goals of this website are:
* Searching for an artist of choice.
* Clearly displaying album art and tracklistings.
* Easy to navigate. 

#### The Business potentials of this website are:
* Selling advertising space to businesses with music related products.
* Currently, the tracks are only 30 seconds long - this is due to either Deezer the API in use only allows users with free accounts to listen to 30 seconds maximum, or because of the limited online music licence. More info can be found here: 
[Click me](https://www.prsformusic.com/-/media/files/prs-for-music/licensing/terms-and-conditions/loml-terms-and-conditions.ashx)
In the future, the site could possibly have a partnership with Deezer whereby the site made a percentage of the sign up fee for users directed towards the Deezer premium accounts.

#### Visitors to this website are searching for:
* Their favorite music artists.
* Albums and tracklisting.

#### This Website is the best way to help them achieve these things because:
* Other websites are too cluttered and hard to navigate.
* Other websites fail to have sound clips to listen to.

#### This website is:
* Uncluttered and has an intuitive search process.
* Providing clear artwork and tracklistings for the selected artist.

## Features:
A single page application.
* The branding logo top centre.
* A search box with a call to action button to the left.
* Below which, the artists' name is displayed and the number of albums that specific artist has.
* To the right, the artist image first will be a spinning vinyl then changes to the artist image during searching.
* Below that again, the last artist that was searched for is displayed and can be clicked to take the user back to that artist. 
* When the initial search is complete a dropdown of artist names will appear.
* On selection of the artist name, the seach box will be populated and their album art is displayed in a section below.
* Clicking on the album art, a box, the tracks and sound samples are displayed. 

#### Home
The home page is made up of a hero image with branding logo, a search box and a call to action button.

#### Album track box
The album trackbox consists of the header "album tracklist" in the top left corner, the total number of tracks listed as a number in the top right corner, the title of the album below this followed by a spinning image of the album cover art and then each track on the album with a thirty second sample.

### Nice to have: 
These features may be included in future releases of this application.

* Type ahead.
I found the type ahead function was not the best away to archive what I wanted in this version of the app but maybe in the future it would be a great addition.

* Image carousel. 
I wanted to incorporate an image carousel, but at this stage I felt it did not give the flexibility I required. However, this carousel created by, Basic 3D Carousel In Pure JavaScript author [loveneet4](https://github.com/internwt/3d-slider) would be a great addition to my future project.



## Testing:

Landing page
* To test user text input box, insert name and press go. The search gets the relevant artist names and displays them to be selected. This feature works as intended. 

Bug found if the user input is left empty and go is pressed. An error will apear in the console, cannot read length of undefined this bug will be removed at a later date.

* Select your artist, text appears and then the artist names dropdown below, works as intended.

Bug found depending on the artist name and whether it’s a single name or double. The search was erratic, either not finding the name at all, or even after the initial search or finding irrelevant artist names. The result was to hyphenate the names before the second search. Doing this helped the search function find and display the relevant data.

* Select the artist by clicking on their name and it populates the input box, hyphenated where necessary. Works as intended.

* Select the artist by clicking on their name. The dropdown clears when clicked. Works as intended.

* Search starts automatically works as intended.

* Artist name is displayed next to artist name. Works as intended.

* Number of albums is displayed next to number of albums. Works as intended.

* After artist name is clicked the history is populated and researches when clicked. works as intended.

* After the second search, the select your album heading appears and works as intended.

* Relevant album art is displayed in the page. Works as intended.

Bug found. Sometimes the album search would bring back albums not necessarily relevant to the artist, for instance if another artist had a song called the artist name, then that album would be included even though it has no relevance. Also if an artist had a feature on a track, this would also be displayed. This could be confusing for a user as it could lead them to wrongly believe that a track was attributed to an incorrect artist.
The solution was, during the album search to remove the hyphen and include a space then compare if the album artist matched the user input and only find albums relevant to the name. This did exclude what was mentioned before but I felt it made for a better user experience.

* Click on the album art and a modal appears - works as intended.

* Modal displays album name - works as intended.

* Modal displays number of tracks - works as intended.

* Modal displays album art that spins - works as intended.

* Modal displays album tracks - works as intended.

* Modal displays samples of tracks to play - works as intended.

* Sample tracks play - works as intended.

* If a track is playing and another is selected the previous track stops and the new track starts - works as intended.

* Close button on modal closes the modal clearing the data and stopping any preview track being played - works as intended.
* Clicking on the background outside the modal closes and clears the data stopping any preview track being played - works as intended.


### Limitations & on going fixes:
* Some albums displayed are not always directly related to selected artist.
* Atitist with more than 3 words in their names can cause errors in the console.
* If there are more than 50 tracks in an album the console will display ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES or net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR sometimes a 502 [Error](https://httpstatuses.com/504) and a 206 [Error](https://httpstatuses.com/206) this is caused by the free API limiting calls for mp3 sample URLs 50 calls in 5 seconds.  It's unlikely the user will experience this problem as most albums, excluding compilations, have less than 50 track anyway.
